Design Input and Design Output

 To minimize retrogression, Input and Output of each design step must be clearly defined: key in ISO9001
 Input and Output are design interfaces, and must be well documented
 If Input is unclear, confirm with person in charge of upper stream design step
 Before releasing Output verify it and investigate it by design review
 Modification or addition to Input must be clearly stated in Output with reason for existence
 Modifications to existing design and newly added design must be clearly designated in Output with reason for existence

Well Organized Document

To be fully conscious of readers: like instructing them
To make design interfaces clear: design input, and design output
To make 5W1H clear (who, what, when, where, why, how)
To make document systematic, and avoid distributed description by organizing your thoughts
To avoid ambiguous expression: no room for arbitrary interpretation by readers
Not to abuse alteration, and to make revision history and distribution history clear

Total LSI Design Flow

To design LSIs using design environment established by platform development
- Quality of the platform determines quality of all products

Platform Development Flow

  slide 67: System design trend
  Conventional design: * Inspration and experience
                       * Excess margin due to paper plans
  Current trend:       * C/System C based design
                       * Co-simulation
                       * Early prototype [Logic bench]
                       * Emulator [Celaro]

 slide 82: Timing verification
 
 STA: Static Timing Analysis
• Structure of gate-level logic description is analyzed and then compared
with timing constraints
• Test patterns are not required
• Synchronous paths can be 100% verified
• Asynchronous logic and other special circuit cannot be analyzed
• Special paths must be specified manually

DTA: Dynamic Timing Analysis
• Logic simulation handling delay timing is executed
• Verification of all paths is unrealistic because huge test patterns are required

-> Verify synchronous paths with STA, and use DTA for limited paths that cannot be checked by STA. Always do synchronous
design except for unavoidable case!

slide 98: layout design
test design --> floor planning 2 --> layout (P&R) --> timing verification --> logic verification --> signal integrity check
--> layout verification --> mask data generation

slide 104: signal integrity

In LSI design adopting nanometer technologies, preservingsignal integrity and its verification become indispensable
Signal Integrity is classified:
1) IR drop and ground bounce
Voltage across parasitic resistors reduces power supply voltage and raises ground voltage at each transistor.
These bring about malfunction or timing delay increase at each gate.
2) Cross Talk (X-talk)
Noise between multiple signal lines brings about malfunction or timing delay increase at each gate.
3) Electro Migration (EM)
Excessive, repeated electric current damages wiring (wiring stress).
4) Hot Carrier (HC)
Excessively energized electrons damage transistor (Trs. stress).

slide 117: layout verification

DRC and LVS are the two major tools for layout verification.
<DRC: Design Rule Check>
<LVS: Layout Vs Schemathic Check>
- Check width, space, and overlap of patterns among several layout layers according to layout rules.
- In case of any violations, correct layout and check again. Repeat this process until no violation is reported at all.
<LVS: Layout Vs Schemathic Check>
- Check whether layout corresponds to reference, i.e. circuit diagram (netlist).
- In case of inconsistency, correct layout and check again. Repeat this process until inconsistency is solved.

slide 119: LSI Product Troubles and Designs

- Functional errors
• deterministic fault --> to be avoided by logic verification
• intermittent fault --> to be avoided by logic and timing verification
- Marginal problems
• heat, low power supply voltage --> to be avoided by circuit simulation
• noise --> to be avoided by circuit simulation
- Fabrication problems
• screening of defective devices --> to be solved by DFT (Design For Test)
- Fluctuation of fabrication conditions
• yield problem --> to be solved by DFM
(Design For Manufacturing)
- Aged deterioration
• hot carrier --> to be avoided by signal integrity check
• electro migration --> be avoided by signal integrity check
